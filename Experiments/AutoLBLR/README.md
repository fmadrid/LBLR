# AutoLBLR Experiments
The `RunExperiment.m` script can be used to run AutoLBLR and define program execution options.

```
Experiment Parameters
    PATH           = '../../Datasets/EPG';  
    DATASET        = 'EPG1.mat'
    OUTPUT_FOLDER  = 'EPG1_001';            % Outputs all results to this directory
    SAVEPLOTS      = false;                 % Save the plots generated by AutoLBLR to file?
    
AutoLBLR Parameters
    MODEL_LENGTH = 100;     % Size of the largest motif
    BITS         = 4;       % Discretization cardinality (Suggested Values: 4, 6, 8)
    BLIND        = false;   % Indicates if the solution vector is hidden to AutoLBLR
        
    --- These options shouldn't need to be changed ---
    %EXCLUSION_RANGE = LENGTH/4;        % 
    %MAX_ITERATIONS  = 100;             % By definition, iteration count is capped at length(DATASET) / LENGTH.
    %COLORS          = {'r', [0 1 1]};  % Overwrites the default plot colors (see AutoLBLR description)
